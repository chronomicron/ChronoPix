ChronoPix – Intelligent Photo Scanner & Organizer
Project Overview
ChronoPix is a Python-based application designed to scan, analyze, and organize photos from various storage volumes (hard drives, USB sticks, CDs, etc.). It leverages AI to intelligently classify and sort images while providing users with full control over backup and organization.

Core Features
✅ Volume Scanning: Explore a specified drive or folder hierarchy to locate images.
✅ Image Identification: Detect various camera image formats (JPG, JPEG, IMG, etc.).
✅ Backup & Organization: Allow users to copy/move images to a managed archive.
✅ Multithreading: Optimize scanning performance by processing multiple tasks in parallel.
✅ AI Integration:

Face detection & recognition for automatic labeling.
Grouping images by people or location.
Intelligent classification of photos.
✅ Database Management: Store metadata for fast searching and retrieval.
✅ User Control: Options to keep, move, or delete photos from their original locations.
Technology Stack
Language: Python
GUI Framework: PyQt
AI & ML: PyTorch, face_recognition, and pretrained models
Database: SQLite or a lightweight DB for metadata storage
Multithreading: Python’s threading and multiprocessing
Version Control: Git (local + GitHub for backups)
Development Goals
Build a functional UI with PyQt.
Implement efficient file scanning with multithreading.
Integrate AI for image analysis & classification.
Develop a searchable database for quick photo retrieval.
Optimize for performance and scalability.
